Conspiracies of Society “Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced,where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is
made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy tooppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons norproperty will be safe.”
                                                                                     Frederick Douglass
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
Man has become the marionette, puppet and like a toy of people’shand, lost his own persuasions and thinking, engaged to plan, to design
or to formulate the conspiracies and tries to dissolve it in the life ofother person’s by hook or by crook. All have been created by the same soil, all of the offspring’s of Hazart Adam, all have sent to serve humanity and all are isometric and commensurate without any
discrimination but there are huge differences among their nature’s tones, behaviors, attitudes and taste.


“Attitude is simply a one thing but it is enough for…..one to determine, to know about one’s personality, it gives a proper shape to your character and like a differentiating chamber between good and a bad one” 


Man always tries to beat or defeat to one another in the race of accomplishing acquisition, pilling business, getting fame and popularity,remarkable and egregious status in society and flourishing, picking up and prosperous in every walk of life . For which he becomes imposter and ravening, make a treacherous plan, forget that one day same thing is repeated in his own life , depicted the bad things in such a way that it is looking god one , acquainted the people and stubbed the knife at the back side .


“A conspiracy is nothing but a secret agreement of a number of men for the pursuance of policies which they dare not admit in public.”


One friend cheat to other one only for getting and securing position,brother betrays to other one in business only for money and lucre,
politician conspired only for achieving seat, vote’s popularity and fame among the mass means in each and every way our society is bounded and besiege in the vicinity of many conspiracies and be shrews.


Man forgets about the humanity, modesty, feelings and sentiments of people and becomes so much selfish and self-centered. He just wants
to get, to acquire the money at any cost.Every stage of life man becomes assassin of other man not in terms of murdering but try to snatches and destroy all the hopes and aspirations of other person. He enclosed himself in the vicinity of four walls of
selfishness and tries to get only his profit, only his benefits and sorry to say not for others………………because “the world is in a constant
conspiracy against the brave”.


“You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.”
